{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.

<br >
The framework provides flexible programming model built on already established and familiar Spring idioms and best practices, including support 
for persistent pub/sub semantics, consumer groups, and stateful partitions.

{% endcapture %}
{% capture main_content %}
The core building blocks of Spring Cloud Stream are:

* *Destination Binders*: Components responsible to provide integration with the external messaging systems.
* *Destination Bindings*: Bridge between the external messaging systems and application provided Producers and Consumers of messages (created by the Destination Binders).
* *Message*: The canonical data structure used by producers and consumers to communicate with Destination Binders (and thus other applications via external messaging systems).

Currently Spring Cloud Stream supports [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit) and [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka) binders with more binder implementations in the pipeline _(such as: [Google PubSub](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gcp/tree/master/spring-cloud-gcp-pubsub-stream-binder) and [AWS Kinesis](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-aws-kinesis))_.

As long as Spring Cloud Stream and a Spring Cloud Stream Binder dependencies are on the classpath any Spring Boot application with `@EnableBinding` binds to the external 
messaging system (e.g. [Rabbit MQ](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit) or [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka), 
depending on the binder-implementation of choice).

For more comprehansive step-by-step _getting started_ experience please refer to the
[Quick Start](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/Elmhurst.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#_quick_start) section of the user guide.

Below is the fully functional Spring Cloud Stream application, which receives and logs data to the console.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableBinding(Sink.class)
public class LoggingConsumerApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(LoggingConsumerApplication.class, args);
	}

	@StreamListener(Sink.INPUT)
	public void handle(Person person) {
		System.out.println("Received: " + person);
	}

	public static class Person {
		private String name;
		public String getName() {
			return name;
		}
		public void setName(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}
		public String toString() {
			return this.name;
		}
	}
}
```
As you can see from the preceding example:

* We've enabled `Sink` binding (input-no-output) by using `@EnableBinding(Sink.class)`. Doing so signals to the framework to initiate binding to the messaging system, 
where it automatically creates the destination (that is, queue, topic, and others) that are bound to the `Sink.INPUT` channel.

* We've added a handler method to receive incoming messages of type `Person`. Doing so lets you see one of the core features of the framework: It tries to automatically convert incoming message 
payloads to type `Person`.

You can start the application by simply running its `main(..)` method.

### Apache Kafka Client Compatibility
Spring Cloud Stream supports a variety of Apache Kafka Client releases. To learn more about it, please refer to the [Apache Kafka Client Compatibility](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/wiki/Kafka-Client-Compatibility) section in the Wiki page.
